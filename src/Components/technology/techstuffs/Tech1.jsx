        <p>A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled <br /> vehicle used to carry a payload from Earth's surface to <br /> space, usually to Earth orbit or beyond. Our WEB-X <br /> carrier rocket is the most powerful in operation. Standing <br /> 150 metres tall, it's quite an awe-inspiring sight on the <br /> launch pad!</p>
